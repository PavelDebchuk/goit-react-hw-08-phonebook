      <p className={s.titleDescription}>
        People use the contact book every day. They prefer to use them rather than
        memorize phone numbers by heart, as it is very convenient to use. For example
        mobile phone books where you just have to choose a name person, click on it and it
        will be automatically made dialing a number.{' '}
      </p>
      <p className={s.titleDescription}>
        The <span className={s.titlePart}>Phonebook</span> can be implemented even within
        the company. Using the contact book, employees can call each other in seconds.
        Remember the numbers or ask colleagues are not required. Because all data will be
        stored in the electronic contact book.
